In March of 2022, I came to Stanford University from China, as my partner was
pursuing her PhD at the University. We met four years ago through a Leadership
Development Program in the field of Marine Conservation. After she left for her Ph.D
program, we could not stand living apart any longer, so I temporarily put aside my
work in China and came to California to be with her.
On my first day at Stanford, my partner took me around the University campus. I
was attracted by the beauty of the landscape: the church, the sculptures, the trees,
the botanical gardens, and the vast sports fields. What impressed me the most was
the statue of the Stanford family in the Memorial Garden. Leland Stanford Junior
held a piece of paper with the words “Dedicated to science and the good of
humanity”. The sentence made me think of the philosophy proposed by Immanuel
Kant on human reasoning and free will. And so, I understand the words on
the statue to imply more his “dedication to human reasoning and freedom”.

Stanford offers a lot of events in Art and Music for the international student
community and their families. My partner and I went to the Bing Concert Hall to
watch performances almost every week. We enjoyed musicals, ballet, modern
dance, symphony orchestra, Taiko, American traditional folk music, rock bands, and
a Cloud Gate Dance Theater performance from Taiwan and so on. These
performances have made our lives so colorful and have fed our spirits.
Over the weekends, my partner and I explored interesting places around the
Stanford campus, and at times we took public transportation or a Zipcar. Some of
our favorite places include the Filoli Historic House and Garden, Gamble Garden,
and the Palo Alto Children’s Museum. We also went to Half Moon Bay for a big
pumpkin festival. There was a grand parade and food made from local pumpkins
and several band performances at the festival. This festival has a history of more
than 100 years, and it is a good model for businesses to give back to the local
community. We felt good about spending money here.
I also got to know the professors, other students, and exchange scholars at the
Stanford Center on Chinese Economy and Institutions. I communicated with them a
lot about China's education and social issues and learned about some of their
projects in China. I think it would be great if my town could collaborate with
Stanford University on an educational program for local kids one day.
In my English classes, I met many good teachers and classmates. Sometimes we
had lunch together after class and shared our stories. At the end of each quarter,
some teachers would organize a party for us, such as a potluck. Some teachers
invited us to their homes for Thanksgiving and hosted a formal holiday meal. This
was my first Thanksgiving in the US. I felt very lucky, happy, and grateful to be
welcomed like this by the greater Stanford Community. My good teachers and
classmates at Stanford have inspired me to bring kindness and beauty to the world
every day
