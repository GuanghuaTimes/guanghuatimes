## Lyrics

When I was young I'd listen to the radio
Waitin' for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along, it made me smile
Those were such happy times and not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well

Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine

All my best memories come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry, just like before
It's yesterday once more
