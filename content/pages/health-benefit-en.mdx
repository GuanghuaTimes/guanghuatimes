Producing salt using traditional wisdom is beneficial to health.

The sea salt produced here is not made using modern methods but through the wisdom of our ancestors. In addition to removing harmful impurities, it also retains a large number of beneficial trace elements for the human body. When villagers boil corn or porridge and add LaoShi salt alone, the taste is fresh and sweet, becoming a beautiful memory for the older generation of LaoShi.

When buying a bag of salt in the supermarket, it looks white, delicate, and inexpensive. The sea salt commonly found on the market is usually produced by a rapid scientific method called "synthetic salt". The "instant" sea salt loses many beneficial trace elements during the process. These trace elements can help improve immunity. "In the past, when we had a cold, we didn't need to see a doctor. We would rest at home for two or three days, but now people can die from a cold. Oil, salt, sugar, water, we breathe in these important nutrients every day, and the only component that has changed the most is sea salt. If we do not inhale the trace elements in sea salt for a long time, it will affect our body's antibodies and our ability to resist epidemics."

Sea salt produced through traditional methods can retain certain mineral elements. The chloride content is lower than that of industrial refined salt commonly found on the market. Therefore, it has a mild taste, layers of flavor, and a lingering sweet aftertaste.
