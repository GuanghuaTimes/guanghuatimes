We are organized salt people!

This rural village, LaoShi, once prosperous and thriving, eventually declined as people left and ecological destruction occurred. In recent years, villagers have made efforts to rebuild a new salt field. In their vision, this place will become a conservation village integrating culture, religion, ecology, and tourism. The LaoShi Salt Conservation Center is a non-profit organization spontaneously established by salt people, responsible for preserving and promoting the culture and ecological conservation of LaoShi village. Through guided tours, sharing sessions, workshops, and thematic experiences, more people get to know about the values of Danzhou, natural conservation, simple living, etc., and their body, mind, and spirit are all stretched and improved. We hope to promote rural conservation and inherit the intergenerational values of rural and suburban areas in Hainan, and are willing to work together for the next generation to leave behind a cleaner land.
