    "What is the eternal reliance of the hometown, we do not know, we only know that because of people, the hometown never withers. This is a sentence in the vision of the foundation, which reveals that volunteers in the foundation organization become the backbone of the structure through the transmission operation of the board of directors, the volunteer group, and the secretariat. The foundation's volunteer group has four types of organizations: the 'Wenjiao Small Volunteer' of junior high school students, the 'High School Volunteer' composed of high school students, the 'Xin Gangyi' from the college youth association, and the adult volunteer group. The four-stage organization is passed down in one vein, forming a close inheritance and public participation network. Through community participation, visit learning, and interactive fellowship, the volunteers of the foundation are always full of energy and motivation, ready to go, and sustainable. It is hoped that the people of Laoshi Village will increase their identification and public affairs participation in their hometown through the process of personal participation.",

    "什麼是故鄉永遠的依靠，我們不知道，我們只知道，因為人，故鄉永不凋謝。這是基金會願景中的一段話，道出義工在基金會組織中，透過董事會、義工團、秘書處的傳動運作成為架構中的骨幹。本會義工團有國中生的「文教小義工」、高中職學生組成的「高校義工」、來自大專青年聯誼會的「新港誼」、以及成人大義工，四種階段組織一脈相傳，形成緊密的傳承及公共參與網絡。透過社區參與、參訪學習、互動聯誼，使本會義工隨時充滿能量動力而蓄勢待發，永續不墜。期盼新港鄉親藉由親自參與的過程，彼此學習與合作，增加對故鄉的認同及公共事務參與力。",
